# 3.1.1

*Released*

**Features:**

- You can now pass a `flag` option to {% url "`cy.writeFile()`" writefile %}. The {% url "following flags" https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system_flags %} are available.
- The {% url "Module API" module-api %} now returns the `runUrl` from `cypress.run()`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a bug where Cypress would error when a secure cookie flag was set and then expired from an `https` url without the subsequent secure flag. Due to the way Cypress was constructing the url, this would fail to actually remove the cookie. Fixes {% issue 1321 %}, {% issue 1264 %} and {% issue 1799 %}.
- We updated how we handle {% url "`trashAssetsBeforeRuns`" configuration#Screenshots %} behavior. We now trash the contents of the {% url "`screenshotsFolder`" configuration#Folders-Files %} and {% url "`videosFolder`" configuration#Folders-Files %} directories instead of trashing the directories themselves. This helps maintain any file access permissions for the directories. Fixes {% issue 1943 %} and {% issue 2600 %}.
- Fixed bug where clicking to 'reload' Cypress tests would cause Cypress to freeze with a React error. Fixes {% issue 2590 %}.
- Fixed bug where mocked Dates using {% url "`cy.clock()`" clock %} would not be an instance of `Date`. Fixes {% issue 2570 %}.
- Directories within specs whose names contain `.` are now correctly read as directories instead of spec files within the Test Runner. Fixes {% issue 2423 %}.
- Cypress no longer automatically takes screenshots of skipped tests. Fixes {% issue 2368 %}.
- Fixed issue where the handler within {% url "`cy.task()`" task %} would incorrectly resolve as `undefined`. Fixes {% issue 2553 %}.
- Fixed bug where only the first DOM element of an array of DOM elements would be blacked out after being passed as argument to `blackout` within {% url "`cy.screenshot()`" screenshot %}. Fixes {% issue 2508 %}.
- We fixed an issue involving timers after running {% url "`cy.screenshot()`" screenshot %}. Fixes {% issue 2432 %}.
- The Test Runner now retries node-originated errors from our internal API requests. Fixes {% issue 2341 %}
- Fixed issue with multiple `readyStateChanges` with the same `readyState`. Fixes {% issue 1150 %}.
- Fixed Type error being thrown for users using TypeScript 3. Fixes {% issue 2363 %}.
- Fixed bug when a promise was not returned from a task that would throw an error instead of printing correct error message. Fixes {% issue 2553 %}

- We are now collecting more environment variables from runs when run in Semaphore, GitLab, Bitbucket, Team Foundation Server, Codeship, and Shippable. Addresses {% issue 2460 %}, {% issue 2358 %}, {% issue 2343 %}, and {% issue 2453 %}
- The Test Runner's search now resets when switching between projects. Addresses {% issue 2512 %}
